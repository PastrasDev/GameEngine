	/// <para>8-bit per channel planar YUV 4:2:0 video resource format. This format is subsampled where each pixel has its own Y value, but each 2x2 pixel block shares a single U and V value. The runtime requires that the width and height of all resources that are created with this format are multiples of 2. The runtime also requires that the left, right, top, and bottom members of any RECT that are used for this format are multiples of 2. This format differs from DXGI_FORMAT_NV12 in that the layout of the data within the resource is completely opaque to applications. Applications cannot use the CPU to map the resource and then access the data within the resource. You cannot use shaders with this format. Because of this behavior, legacy hardware that supports a non-NV12 4:2:0 layout (for example, YV12, and so on) can be used. Also, new hardware that has a 4:2:0 implementation better than NV12 can be used when the application does not need the data to be in a standard layout.
